            <p id="problem-p">
                In most colleges, student achievements — from certificates and internships to workshops, volunteering,
                and leadership
                roles — remain scattered across departments or lost in paperwork. This creates problems not only for
                students, who
                struggle to build a verified portfolio, but also for faculty and institutions during mentoring,
                reporting, and
                accreditation processes like NAAC or NIRF. This
                lack of a centralized digital system makes it difficult for students to build verified portfolios and
                for institutions
                to efficiently manage accreditation and reporting. <br>
                <h3 id="aim-statement">
                    We aim to solve this with a Smart Student Hub that unifies records, achievements, and institutional
                    data — all in one
                    place

            <h2>“Why Student's Hub?”</h2>
            <p>Student and institutional records are often scattered — notes stored in folders, certificates in
                separate drives, event
                details lost in emails, and achievements left undocumented. Student's Hub brings everything together in
                one place. It
                goes beyond a simple notes app — offering a verified, comprehensive digital portfolio that secures
                academic,
                co-curricular, and professional milestones, while also supporting institutions with seamless record
                management and
                accreditation readiness.</p>
